# Frontend
This project needs the backend running in the same machine when it's deployed, so before all, clone the backend and run it.


## Clone
Run `git clone https://github.com/oscarpr/almundo-front.git` to clone the project.


## Install
Run `ng i` to install the project dependencies.


## Run
Run `ng server` to run a server that deploy the app.


## Responsive
To test the responsive design use the browser tools, have in mind that the backend is not remote.


Thanks for all :D!
